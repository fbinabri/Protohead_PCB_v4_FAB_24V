# Protohead_PCB_v4_FAB_24V

This repository includes an alternative pcb for this DIY HEAD:
https://github.com/imarin2/ProtoHead_v4

that in addition to what is explained in that other repository, also makes available the 24 V and the servo1 to the user.

# So what is this in short?

Just a PCB, not a full head, featuring:
- Full Kicad project (for libraries look here: https://github.com/imarin2/FABHeadLibraries)
- Flatcam project for insulation milling
- Heekscad project for cutout and slots
- The gcode to manufacture the PCB with a FABtotum (the gcode is for my tools, see wiki: http://wiki.fabtotum.com/doku.php?id=pcb_milling_workflow#preparation_tools)
